        <h5>Collection and Use of Information</h5>
        <p>
          We don't collect anything that we don't need. By submitting data to us, we collect certain personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you and that may be used to contact you online or offline, in several different ways on the site (the "information").
          <br><br>But we may collect information from you only when you provide it to us (any information that you submitted when you complete any online registration or subscription form). All submitted information will be deemed under this policy. We collect such information to assist in the administration and operation of the site and to provide you an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience with respect thereto.
        </p>
